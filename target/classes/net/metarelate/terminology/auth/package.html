Manages authorization. The authorization model is based on a user-action-target model.<br/>
For every combination of user-action-target, the AuthRegistryManager reports whether the action is allowed or not.
<strong><em>AuthRegistryManager</em> is the only package that should be accessed from outside this package to ask auth information.</strong><br/>
In order to construct an AuthRegistryManager, an AuthServer is needed. AuthServer provides basic authorization information (true/false for a triple: agent-action-target).<br/>
AuthRegistryManager builds on these information by adding special processing for "all" and potentially by managing inheritance of authorization from containing registers.<br/>
 
In this prototype also AuthServer and StubAuthServer are provided as public, as in use by the command line.
In a more realistic implementation of the system, AuthServer would accept extra configuration parameters and its implementation could rely on an external architecture.

Also note that AuthServer is assumed to follow an OpenWorld policy. It returns whether it knows an action is allowed. Negation doesn't imply this is forbidden.
AuthManager can conclude that an action is forbidden after inspecting AuthManager for the current and the containing registers.
