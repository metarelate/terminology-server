A brief description of the template language

<!-- tmtOpen>
<tmtClose -->
What is found between these two comments is "parsed" by the template manager 
(i.e.: what is not between a pair of such tags is rendered verbatim).

$str+$ block: a string, where content in << >> is replaced according to the following table:


<<tmtLabel>>
<<tmtDescription>>
<<tmtAuthors>>

<<tmtPageTitle>> Expands to the page title (usually in <head></head>)
<<tmtPageDescription>>	The description for a page (code or set)
<<tmtPageAuthor>>		The "author" for a page (code or set): should this be the owner ?
<<tmtGlobalTitle>>		The title for a complete terminology collection
<<tmtGlobalAuthor>>		The author(s) for a complete terminology collection
