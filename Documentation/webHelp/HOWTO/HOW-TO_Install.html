      <h2>Types of Installation</h2>
    </a> Several installations of the WMO TDCF Web accessible registers
    (TDCF-Register) are possible, depending on functionalities provided.<br>
    To make a <b>web-representation of codes</b> available, there is no
    need to install any particular software other than a web server and
    only a minimum of configuration is required. The terminology server
    in fact renders all codes simply as files with a proper directory
    structure. A copy of these files that is performed maintaining the
    directory structure (e.g.: recursively or via a tar archieve), can
    be just deployed in a web server directory for "web publication".
    Clearly, the root of the web server must be compatible with the URLs
    used for the codes (note that URIs and URLs may differ for testing
    or other purposes. cfr. <a
      href="Technical/Terminology%20Manager%20Platform%20Design.html">Terminology




      Manager platform design</a>).<br>
    To allow for modification of codes (currently via command line), the
    full <b>Terminology Server</b> must be installed. The Terminology
    Server requires that an RDF representation from which to build a
    terminology model is already available.<br>
    Such representation is provided essentially by the D2RQ system,
    following conventions outlined in the <a
      href="Technical/Terminology%20Manager%20Platform%20Design.html">Terminology




      Manager Platform Design</a> document. The D2RQ system complements
    some functionalities in the Terminology Server to provide the <b>Terminology




      Mapper</b>.<br>

        <p>Web-representation of codes<br>

      </a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A web server supporting content negotation via .var files
        (e.g.: Apache). The system is tested under: Apache 2.2.22 (Unix)<br>

    <h3>Terminology Manager</h3>
    <p>All of the above, plus:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A Java runtime system (&gt;1.6). The system is tested under
        OpenJDK 1.10.6 (amazon built) and Java(TM) SE Runtime
        Environment (1.6.0, Mac OSX)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Terminology Mapper</h3>
    <p>All of the above, plus:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A D2RQ installation (ref. Terminology Manager platform
        design). The system is tested under version 0.7<br>
      </li>
      <li>A database supported by D2RQ. The system is tested under:
        mysql 5.1.44</li>
      <li>(Optional) the utility <a
          href="http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html">rapper</a> for
        synatx conversion. The syste, is tested under version 2.0.8.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    In addition to the above, access to a server with permissions to
    operate on the file system and on web accessible directories is
    required.<br>

    <h2>How to install web accessible representations of WMO codes</h2>
    <p>Make sure the <a
        href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_negotiation.html"
        name="Files">mod_negotation module</a> is installed in Apache.<br>
      Edit the httpd configuration file (usually found at
      /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.con on unix systems) to specify the
      directory index option as folllows:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var code.var register.var</pre>
    <p> (it should include code.var and register.var).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Is is then sufficient to copy and expand a tarball with
      terminology files in a web accessible directory. An example of
      such file is available <a href="../resources/allCodesTar.tgz">here</a>
      (this referes to reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo URIs and
      URLs, and links would appear as broken if installed elsewhere).<br>
    </p>
    <a name="Server">
      <h2>How to install the Terminology Manager</h2>
    </a>
    <p>The current version of the terminology manager can be downloaded
      <a href="../resources/WMOTermReg.jar">here</a> a boundle of the
      rquired libs is available <a
        href="http://reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo/resources/libs.tgz">here</a>
      (all the included jars must be made visibile prior or at command
      execution). This piece of software is self contained, requiring
      only a Java Run Time environment for execution. The software will
      need to operate on a triplestore whose file location is specified
      via command line (cfr. <a
        href="HOWTO/HOW-TO%20make%20a%20mapping.html">HOW-TO make a
        mapping</a> and <a
        href="HOW-TO%20publish%20a%20terminology%20model.html">HOW-TO
        publish a terminology model</a>). The Terminology Manager will
      need access to the file system both to access (r/w) triplestore
      files and to write/delete files in a directory served by the web
      server.<br>
      If the Terminology Manager is used to generate a mapping, a
      triplestore, if not present, will be initialized in the specified
      location.<br>
    </p>
    <a name="Mapper">
      <h2>How to install the mapping engine</h2>
    </a> The mapping engine is in part contained in the Terminology
    Manager, and in part relies on the presence of <a
      href="http://d2rq.org">D2RQ</a> on the system. D2RQ, at its time,
    requires access to a relational engine with proper read-only
    permissions on a datatabase containg a representation of tables to
    be mapped. For installation of D2RQ please refer to the D2RQ
    documentation. Security settings are specific to the chosen
    relational engine.<br>
