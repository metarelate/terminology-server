    <h1>How to make a mapping from WMO tables to an RDF terminology
      model</h1>
    <font color="#ff0000"></font><font color="#000000">Before following
      these instruction, make sure the system is installed. Refer to <a
        href="HOW-TO_Install.html">HOW-TO Install</a> for further
      details.<br>
      <br>
      Generating a mapping from tables is a very flexible process, that
      can follow different paths and have different arrangements of
      configuration files (for details of the process refer to the </font><a
      href="../Technical/Terminology_Manager_Platform_Design.html">Terminology


      Manager platform design</a>).<br>
    In the following, we illustrate the steps needed for a typical
    example, pointing to relevant configuration files examples.<br>
    Broadly speaking, a mapping consists of two parts: mapping tables to
    an RDF representation of tables plus terminology structure, and
    building a terminology model from this representation. The first
    part requires the execution of the <a href="http://d2rq.org">D2RQ</a>
    command, the second part requires the execution of the MetMap
    command line utility, provided by the TerminologyModel package.<br>
    In what follows, steps of the first part as indicated via letters
    (A,B,..), steps in the second part by numbers.<br>
    Additional steps sequences and configuration options are then
    discussed.<br>
    <h2>Mapping process example<br>
    </h2>
    <h3><font color="#000000">A) Prepare a database with tables to be
        mapped</font></h3>
    <font color="#000000">Tables to be mapped need to be represented in
      a relational database (supported by D2RQ), in order to be accessed
      by the D2RQ mapping engine. It is not important how the tables are
      represented in the database, since a d2rq mapping file specifies
      as how the database "structure" results in RDF. For instance
      whether a given datatype is represented as integer or string in
      RDF is specified in the mapping file, and independent on whether
      the information is present in an integer or string column
      (obviously, a string cannot be represented in a integer column to
      begin with).<br>
      However, d2rq provides a command to generate a "default mapping"
      and in doing so it considers the database structure: for a simple
      table, primary keys are mapped to resources, columns to properties
      (datatypes of eventually object properties if foreign keys are
      defined). For datatypes, the column type is taken into account to
      "type" the corresponding RDF property range.<br>
      A "default mapping" needs to be heavily edited before it can be
      processed by the Terminology Manager: a well though relational
      table representation will minimize the editing required.<br>
      <br>
      For WMO tables object of this prototype, a few modifications have
      been necessary to uniform the data and correct inconsistencies.
      Such modification have been made either to original tables, or in
      the database.&nbsp; The current distribution (available on
      subversion) contains the original WMO tables mapped (CSV format),
      their processed CSV version and a sql dump of the relational
      database. </font>All data modification from the original tables
    to the db represented tables are documented in <a
      href="../Technical/WMO_Tables_alterarions.html">WMO Tables
      alterations</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>B) Prepare a d2rq mapping file</h3>
    As previously noted, d2rq provides a "generate-mapping" commands
    that analyze the relational structure to provide a default mapping.
    We suggest to use this command and then edit the mapping to
    incorporate the command and conventions specified in the <a
      href="../Technical/Terminology_Manager_mapping_consstructs.html">Terminology


      Manager mapping constructs</a>. Example mappings for WMO tables
    are provided in the main distribution (subversion).<br>
    <br>
    <h3>C) Execute D2RQ<br>
    </h3>
    Example command:<br>
    <br>
    <pre>/home/test/d2rqSubsystem/dump-rdf -m /home/test/d2rqWorkArea/BaseDirs.n3 -b http://reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo/tdcf/ &gt; /home/test/d2rqWorkArea/BaseDirs.ntriples</pre>
    <br>
    This instructs D2RQ to dump the content of the database according to
    the mapping specified via the -m option. <br>
    The base url of the resulting RDF is provided via the -b option, and
    the result is saved in the ntriples syntax.<br>
    Credentials for the database connections (and which tables to map)
    are provided in the d2rq mapping files.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>D) Execute rapper (optional)</h3>
    If the output of the previous step is in ntriples format, execute
    the utility rapper to convert the output in rdfxml.<br>
    Example command:<br>
    <br>
    <pre>rapper -i ntriples -o rdfxml-abbrev /home/test/d2rqWorkArea/BaseDirs.ntriples &gt; /home/test/d2rqWorkArea/BaseDirs.rdf
</pre>
    (note that suffixes are used by some part of the system to identify
    the syntax, and their use should be consistent)<br>
    <br>
    <h2>1) Make sure the classpath contains all required libs</h2>
    <p>Example command:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/test/MetOfficeTermRegistry/distrib/WMOTermReg.jar:/home/test/MetOfficeTermRegistry/libs/*</pre>
    <h2>2) Execute MetMap</h2>
    Example command:<br>
    <pre>java uk.gov.metoffice.terminology.commandline.MetMap -d -i rdf -auto -go http://metoffice.gov.uk/wmo/ <br>-tdb /Users/andreasplendiani/DB/MetOffice <br>-f file:////home/test/codeconfigurationFiles/metOfficeDeploymentGeneric.ttl <br>file:////home/test/configurationFiles/metOfficeDeploymentGeneric.ttl <br>file:////home/test/configurationFiles/configurationFiles/genericReasoningConf.ttl <br>file:////home/test/configurationFiles/configurationFiles/genericLabels.ttl <br>file:////home/test/configurationFiles/configurationFiles/genericPropertyAttributes.ttl <br>file:///home/test/d2rqWorkArea/BaseDirs.rdf</pre>
    <font color="#ff0000">Note: the specific synatx of the above command
      is currently changing. Explanations will be provided via --help.</font><br>
    <br>
    Explanation:<br>
    -d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; sets debug on (verbose logging)<br>
    -i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rdf the input is an rdf
    file (remains from an older more complex set of commands, now
    redundant)<br>
    -auto &nbsp; sets a few parameters with "default" values, e.g.:
    current date as the import date, import from tables as action...<br>
    -go&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; specifies the owner (manager) for all
    the generated entities ()<br>
    -tdb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specifies the location (and type) of
    the triplestore.<br>
    -f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specifies a set of
    files that constitute the input.&nbsp; All files are read and merged
    in a unique input processed by the system. Therefore how the
    configuration is cut into files is an arbitrary choice. In this
    example BaseDirs.rdf is the mapping file generated by the previous
    process. Other files contain "static" paramers: server
    configuration, reasoner settings, labels, meta-information on
    properties, reasoning directives and macros. Refer to <a

      Manager platform design</a> for more detail.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Compact commands</h2>
    To simplify portability some macro command is provided (in the
    scripts directory of the distribution).<br>
    <h3>execD2RQ</h3>
    Example command:<br>
    <pre>./execD2RQ.py BaseDirsMap</pre>
    The script relies on a fixed directory structure and performs the
    following steps:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>concatenate the file BaseDirsMap.n3 (".n3" is appended to the
        name provided) with a file containing the database connection
        credential</li>
      <li>calls D2RQ with the appropriate parameters</li>
      <li>calls rapper to convert the ntriples output to rdf/xml (note
        that this could be avoided if D2RQ is called specidying the
        proper output format. At the time of this writing, this option
        was not chosen because of a possible bug).</li>
    </ol>
    Details on the directories where files are or are to be created, as
    well as which credentials to use, are provided in a file
    execd2rqenvironment.txt in the "scripts" directory (the format is
    parameter ONE_SPACE value).<br>
    <br>
    <h3>buildModel</h3>
    Example command:<br>
    <pre>./buildModel.py BaseDirs.rdf<br></pre>
    The script relies on a fixed directory structure and on parameters
    found in modelbuilderenvironment.txt to generated and execute the
    MetMap command.<br>
