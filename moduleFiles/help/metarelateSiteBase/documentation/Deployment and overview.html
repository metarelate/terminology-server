<h1>An overview of the Metarelate Terminology Server<br>
</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Meterelate Terminology server is a system that allows the curation
and publishing of code lists as Linked-Data, Pdf (Latex) or Linked
Data. It allows to maintain the evolution of a base of codes keeping
track of modifications via versioning, and recording which action was
taken when. <br>
<h2>Terminology and conventions adopted</h2>
Throughout this documentation (and largely in the code), we refer to codes as <span style="font-weight: bold;">codes</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">individuals</span>, and we refer to sets as <span style="font-weight: bold;">sets</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">registers</span>. Codes and sets are both subclasses of a more generic <span style="font-weight: bold;">entity</span>.<br>
We indicate URIs as <span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;http://example.com/test&gt;</span> , <span style="font-style: italic;">http://example.com/test</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">ex:test</span> (assuming the definition of a prefix ex.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Concepts and codes</h2>
If we think about the common idea of a code, we would have something like:<br>
<pre>001 : Temperature.</pre>
This code makes sense given a specific context, so for instance we could have the code:<br>
<pre>Measurement Standard 1, 001 : Temperature.</pre>
<br>
With some more detail, we could have something like:<br>
<br>
<pre>Measurement Standard 1</pre>
<pre>Code : 001</pre>
<pre>Definition : Temperature</pre>
<pre>Unit : K</pre>
<pre>Status : Operational</pre>
<pre>Encoding : 26bit</pre>
<br>
In expressing attributes of this code, we are referring to different conceptual entities. We can easily distinguish a <span style="font-weight: bold;">concept</span> (an idea of temperature) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">information artifact</span>
(the code 001, a representation for temperature that was considered
"operational" within some process). We could articulate the concept in
a more complex description, noting that we have a physical entity
(Temperature), a unit of measure (K) and a representation property.<br>
The terminology server supports a representation of codes that can
distinguish these different aspects, and presents them as a set of
interlinked web resources.<br>
In particular the terminology server is built on the idea that codes
are "defined" in registers, that can at their time be organized in
hierarchies of sub-registers. The definition in a register is dependent
upon a <span style="font-weight: bold;">process</span> and a set of <span style="font-weight: bold;">responsible agents</span>,
it isn't dependent on the meaning of the definition. For instance the
DVLA can be seen as a register of vehicles (physical entities), while a
skos:collection can be seen as a register of concepts (for instance a
list of colors).<br>
The terminology server is neutral respect to the nature of what is
registered (physical entity, concept), or what the register is (an
institute, or simply a list definition), but enforce the authority of
the definition. For colors, the register would say that <span style="font-style: italic;">Blue</span> in <span style="font-style: italic;">ColorRegister X</span>
implies that the responsible person for this register has taken
responsibility (according to a process) for its presence in the
register.<br>
<br>
<h2>URI, URL and versioning</h2>
One basic ideas behind the design of the terminology server is that
entities (codes or registers) are identified by URIs. In this system,
URIs are built with a "hackable" convention in which their structure
maps to the register hierarchy and cutting URIs resolve to sensible
results.<br>
For example a URI for a temperature may be defined as:<br>
<pre>http://instituteOfExamples.com/metarelateExamples/Standard1/001</pre>
Chopping the URI would progressively result in:<br>
<pre>http://instituteOfExamples.com/metarelateExamples/Standard1</pre>
(the register where 001 is defined)<br>
<pre>http://instituteOfExamples.com/metarelateExamples</pre>
(the register in which the register Standard1 is defined)<br>
<pre>http://instituteOfExamples.com</pre>
(the institution that is de-fact responsible for publishing this information)<br>
<br>
URIs are immutably associated to the semantics of the identifier and
never change, as far as they denote the same thing. The properties that
pertain to given URI may change in time. The system allows to record
these properties, and access them via URIs which have a version number.<br>
<br>
For instance:<br>
A register may denote the car pool of a company X, which at a give time (corresponding to version 0) has two car, A and B.<br>
<br>
the URI for the car pool could be.<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/companyX</pre>
<br>
the register would provide, for this URI, the following information (in pseudo rdf):<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/companyX hasCar http://carRegister.com/cars/1 </pre>
<br>
at the same time resolving the URI for the code car would result in:<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/cars/1 inPool http://carRegister.com/companyX</pre>
<br>
We could ask the system for the same information respect ton version 0, and we would have:<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/companyX/0</pre>
yields<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/companyX hasCar http://carRegister.com/cars/1 </pre>
and <br>
<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/cars/1/0</pre>
yields<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/companyX hasCar http://carRegister.com/cars/1 </pre>
<br>
Now, let's assume that later in time, the car gets demolished and a new
car (2) is bought. For both the car pool and the car, we denote this
time has version 1 (note that in principle this number could be
different from the two entities).<br>
<br>
We would have:<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/companyX/1</pre>
<br>
yields<br>
<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/companyX hasCar http://carRegister.com/cars/1 </pre>
<br>
(note that the uri for the car pool didn't change. Its meaning didn't
change, it is intended to be the same car pool. The state of the car
pool is changed, and this can be retrieved via the version "URL").<br>
<br>
for the car, we could imagine that:<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/cars/1/1</pre>
yields:<br>
<pre>http://carRegister.com/cars/1 destructionDate DD-MM-YYYY</pre>
<br>
Note that even here the URI for the car doesn't change, even if the car
doesn't exist anymore, as its meaning doesn't change. To make a
parallel, we can imagine that the id for the Titanic didn't change from
when the ship was a project, to when it was built to now that it's only
a memory.<br>
<br>
The terminology manager provide full metadata on why each version
originates, how version links, and provide sensible defaults is an
unspecified state of a code is asked (latest version).<br>
<br>
URIs are identifiers. URLs are like URIs with the additional property
that they resolve on the web (in principle a URI may not resolve). The
terminology server distinguish the two aspects. As we have seen, URLs
can be used to access the information relative to a URI (different
from&nbsp; the URL, as it doesn't contain the version) for a given
point in time. The terminology server also allows to dis-align the two
entity, and publish information about some URIs at a different location
(this feature at the current stage should be rarely used).<br>
<br>
<h2>How to use it (basics)</h2>
The system is released as a zip archive containing an installer
program. A README file details steps required for the installation and,
once installed, a single utility (command line) is made available to
control all operations of the system. Help options are provided within
this utility to guide through the different functionality. The system
is inherently platform-independent, but minor aspects may be
specifically tuned to unix systems.<br>
<br>
<h2>Ingestion, Administration and publishing</h2>
The system allows the batch import of a terminology, which would
normally be the first action (after installation) in a new system. When
a terminology (represented in RDF) is imported (ingested), the system
creates a terminology structure that is persisted on a triplestore
(under the db directory. See <a href="Guide%20to%20the%20defautl%20configuration%20files.html">Guide to the default configuration</a>).<br>
Once a terminology has been imported, it possible to start a web interface that allows to update the terminology.<br>
It is also possible to issue the publishing of the terminology, in different forms. It is possible to:<br>
<ul>
  <li>publish the terminology as latex file</li>
  <li>publish the terminology as a set of files designed to provide a
linked-data representation based on files served by apache via content
negotiation. Note that this requires the apache configuration to be
tweaked to allow .var based content negotiation.</li>
  <li>publish the terminology via an embedded server</li>
  <li>open a sparql server (fuseki) on the content of the triplestore (third party software).</li>
</ul>
Note that in the current implementation only one instance of the
triplestore where files are persisted can be accessed at any time.
Therefore it is not possible to edit and publish the terminology via
the embedded server (or to use fuseki) at the same time.<br>
<br>
The following operational scenarios are possible:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The system only runs the import command, the administrative web
interface or the online publisher at any one time. In practice when
data are edited, access to data is removed.</li>
  <li>The system publishes the terminology as files. The terminology is
still accessible while edit takes place. Changes take place when a new
publish operation is invoked.</li>
  <li>The content of the /db directory is copied between different
instances. In this case a user could edit the terminology, all the
resulting files in /db could then be copied to a second directory and
this can be used to open an online server publishing the terminology
(or a sparql endpoint). This approach minimize down-time when the
terminology is updated.</li>
</ul>
The publication of a terminology as a set of files or via an embedded
server provide distinct pros and cons. The optimal solution depends on
specific requirements.<br>

      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Cannot be used together with the online publishing, unless triplestore files are duplicated.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Note: the system provides a template mechanisms for publishing.
Currently, css, scripts and external information have to be managed
separately and cannot be served by the embedded server. Templates could
include access to such elements from a different server (in the case
the online publisher is used) or the same server (file based
representation only).<br>
<br>
<h2>Process, validation and authority</h2>
The terminology server supports generic processes, custom validation rules and a basic authority model.<br>
The authority model, whose only implementation is file based, is based
on an "authority server" which is able to answer if a triple of the
following form is allowed or not:<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">agentURI actionTypeURI targetURI </span>(potentially any of&nbsp; these may be replaced by an "any" symbol.<br>
The system automatically travel the sub-register containment upstream
until a positive answer is found, or otherwise doesn't allow the action.<br>
A simple configuration example can be found in the default
configuration files under the /auth directory (allowing the default
user to perform any action on any register).<br>
<br>
Generic validation rules can be provided that are applied when the user edits core or registers via the web interface (more in <a href="HOW-TO%20specify%20validation%20constraints.html">HOW-TO specify validation constraints</a>).<br>
<br>
A generic process (validation, validated, obsoletion, ...) as well as allowed transitions can also be configured (more in <a href="HOW-TO%20configure%20a%20process.html">HOW-TO configure a process</a>).<br>
<br>
<h2>Other references</h2>
The Metarelate terminology server originates from a prototype developed
to publish WMO code tables as Linked-Data. Some of the features (e.g.:
import from descriptions in relational tables) are still in part
present in the current systems. Other implementation aspects have been
modified, but the logical model of what at terminology is is unchanged.
Documentation relative to this prototype can be found <a href="oldDocs/webHelp/index.html">here</a>.<br>
