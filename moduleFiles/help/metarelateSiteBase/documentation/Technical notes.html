<h1>Technical notes</h1>
A few notes on the state of the code and possible improvements.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The template design is to be reworked. It currently provides
interfaces for code-varying templates, static templates and
terminology-related templates. However only a few methods with a long
list of parameters are calling. This is equivalent to not using
interfaces!</li>
  <li>The core classess could be reworked as to have core classes
implementing the minimal logic needed to interface with the persistence
layer, and wrappers to implement current functionalities. This would
simplify porting to different backends.</li>
  <li>Trhoughout the system, there is not a clear commitment to strong
or weak typing. Sometimes Terminology Entities are passed, sometimes
URIs (strings), sometimes Resources. There should be a coherent approach throughout the system.</li>
  <li>The exception hierachry should be rationalized.</li>
  <li>Sorting of statements and code comparators could be used more extensively and made more robust.</li>
  <li>Label management is fragmented through the system. It should be
moved to labelManager, that should also be responsible for applying
heuristics.</li>
  <li>References between components of the system could be
rationalized: we could only pass Initializer or use it as a static
class that other elements can access (at the moment components are
passed throughut the system a bit arbitrarily)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
