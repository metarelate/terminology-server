    <h1>Codes and Concepts definitions and conceptualization</h1>
    <p>The object of the Met Office Terminology Manager prototype is to
      make a subset of WMO code tables available as a machine readable,
      semantically annotated web resource. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>BUFR and CREX standards<br>
    </h2>
    <p>BUFR (CREX) and GRIB are "Table driven" formats that can
      be used to encode a variety of messages. They make
      extensive use of "codes", grouped in tables, both to encode
      the message structure and to "semantically" define its
      content. <br>
    </p>
    These tables are: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Table A (BUFR) - Data Categories</li>
      <li>Table A (CREX) - Data Categories. Basically equivalent to
        TableA.</li>
      <li>Table B (CREX-BUFR) - A variety of (mostly) properties, which
        can
        have a values numbers, or more complex encoding (cfr. Codes and
        Flags
        table). Table B is in practice a grouping of tables (about 40).</li>
      <li><i>Table C (BUFR) - Operators<br>
        </i></li>
      <li><i>Table C (CREX) - Operators <br>
        </i></li>
      <li><i>Table D (BUFR) - Macros</i></li>
      <li><i>Table D (CREX)- Macros </i><br>
      </li>
      <li>GRIB (B) - A variety of (mostly) properties. This is in
        practice a
        grouping of Tables.</li>
      <li>Common Tables (from C11 to C13) - Tables common to
        GRIB/BUFR/CREX</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Codes and concepts in BUFR/GRIB Table Driven Code Formats</h2>
    <p>The nature of codes in BUFR/GRIB tables is very varied.</p>
    <p>First, some tables (Table C and D, both BUFR and CREX) provides
      codes that don't encode concepts, but macros or operators. Thy are
      intended to guide a message parser to take decision on how to
      parse part of a message and they are analogous to language
      structure.<br>
      The other tables are meant to provide codes for entities. In some
      case, such entities are individuals (e.g.: Melbourne, a center of
      origin of a message), in other cases they are properties or
      concepts (e.g. Dew-Point).</p>
    <p>Codes cannot be considered simple designator of a concept. First,
      as codes are agreed on and discussed within a governance process,
      they have their own properties, independent from the meaning they
      refer to. An example of property that pertain to the code are
      "Status" (operational or in validation). An extreme example of the
      distinction between codes and meaning is represented by codes that
      are "operational", but whose "definition" is "Reserved" (sometimes
      by a specified entity). There is no meaning associated to these
      codes, yet they have been object of a process and a few predicates
      have been asserted on the code themselves.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In addition, the relation between codes and concepts can be
      complex or unclear, a few examples follow:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some code tables are redundant, probably because different
        tables are used in different parts of a message (E.g. Common
        Table C1 and Common Tables C11-12)</li>
      <li>Implicit codes. In BUFR Codes and Flags Tables, codes
        corresponding to category 20003 (current weather) present an
        implicit hierarchy. In fact their description is asserted, for
        instance for code 00 (Cloud development not observed or not
        observable) and for the group 00-49 (No precipitation at the
        station at the time of observation). The latter is in practice
        an implicit code for a super-class fore the concepts denoted by
        codes 00-49.</li>
      <li>Partial codes. Some codes don't univocally denote an entity.
        For instance data-subcategories (Common Table 13) are only
        unique in combination with the code for the data category (Table
        A).</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Complex codes. Some codes can point to different meanings
          depending on the use of other codes in other parts of the
          message. For instance the originating center of a message
          (implicit property) is defined via a code in Common Table 11,
          while the sub-center is defined via a code from Common Table
          12. However, these code work in combination. The code from
          Table 11 in fact is meant to refer to the center of origin
          when the code from Table 12 is zero, and is meant to refer to
          a sub-center of origin otherwise. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Codes that don't refer to concepts (as previously mentioned).
          Some code (e.g. "3" in Common Code Table C1) are simply
          reserved for use from some institution (though it could be
          said that they refer to an unknown individual of a known
          class). Another example is code 255 in Table C1 (Missing
          value).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Codes that act as redirections. [MISSING EXAMPLE. DO THEY
          REALLY EXIST?]</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><br>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Codes that refer to more meanings, across versions or
          standards. For instance code 255 in Table A is "Indicator for
          local use" for CREX edition and "Other category" for CREX
          edition 2. Temperature in Table B have different unit of
          measures (K or C) for CREX or BUFR standards, thus denoting
          different concepts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><br>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Flags. Some "codes" express combinations of different codes.
          In this case a code corresponds to different property-object
          assertions, or can denote an inconsistent condition.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Combinatorics and Macros. In general, concepts can be
          represented in BUFR both via a specific code (e.g.: a code for
          "temperature in given scale with a given instrument") or via a
          Macro which compose the meaning out of "smaller" codes (e.g.:
          code for measure, code for scale, code for instrument). There
          seems to be no rule or convention on which approach to use. In
          general the same concepts can potentially be represented by
          different code combinations (or unique codes).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      -----<br>
    </p>
    <p>Codes that specifies entities which denote (semantically) the
      content of a message are very varied in nature and usage. In
      particular:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Codes can refer to classes (e.g. data category), individuals
          (e.g.: center of origin) or properties<sup><a
              class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc"
href="file:///Users/andreasplendiani/code/eclipseWorkspace/MetOfficeTermRegistry/Documentation/web/Introduction/Codes_and_Concepts_definitions_and_conceptualization.html#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>
          (e.g. temperature).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Codes can be used in implicit or explicit statements. For
          instance Originating Center (Common Table 1) refers to an
          individual which is the object of a "subject-predicate-object"
          statement<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc"
href="file:///Users/andreasplendiani/code/eclipseWorkspace/MetOfficeTermRegistry/Documentation/web/Introduction/Codes_and_Concepts_definitions_and_conceptualization.html#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a></sup>
          whose subject is the (implicit) message and whose (implicit)
          property is 'has originating center', where this property is
          identified by the byte-position in the message where the code
          appears. In other cases, a temperature code can be used to
          identify the meaning of a value it refers to, as it is the
          case for temperature (Table B, category 12).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There is only an indirect and ambiguous distinction between
          codes that refer to object-properties (properties relating two
          entities) and data-type properties (properties relating an
          entity to its attributes). The former have as unit of measure
          "Code Table" which implies they refer to another entity, or a
          set of values!</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="western">Relations between codes and meaning</h3>
    <p>The relation between codes and meaning (intended as a computable
      reference) is very confused. It is probably not possible, without
      carrying an extensive analysis of all codes, to list all
      representational artifacts in BUFR/GRIB tables. We list a sample
      of
      artifacts encountered:</p>

      <h2 class="western">Using the Semantic Web for terminology
        management</h2>
      <p>Technologies from the Semantic Web offer an ideal solution for
        the
        management of terminologies such as the ones found in the
        BUFR/GRIB
        code tables. In particular they offer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A way to represent term on the web that is easy to access,
            providing human readable as well as machine processable
            description in a variety of formats (html, xml, json,... RDF
            is format independent), as well as integration with other
            resources and framework (e.g.: wikipedia, linked data).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A mechanism to univocally define terms definition which is
            robust respect to local or global contexts (each information
            publishers use a namespace on which it has privileges).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A native support for multi-lingual information (embedded in
            RDF)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A native support to represent taxonomies and other
            nomenclature artifacts that is both easy to browse from
            users (e.g. narrower/broader maps to links that can be
            browsed through) and queried computationally (e.g.: query
            for a term can return all more specific terms).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A native support for defining and computing the consistency
            or equivalence of terms across different terminologies
            (internal or external to WMO).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A varied set of technologies that can be used to build an
            information system to manage terminologies and that can be
            combined with existing technologies (e.g. relational
            databases).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Technologies to serve queries which can be expressed at
            different levels of abstraction (e.g.: queries for a higher
            term in a taxonomy returns results matching sub-terms).</p>

      <h1 class="western">BUFR and GRIB Tables on the Web (analysis)</h1>
      <p>Publishing and structuring BUFR and GRIB codes on the
        (Semantic)
        Web are two related but largely independent tasks: one concerns
        the
        development of an infrastructure to handle terminologies, the
        other
        the development of an ontology to structure terminologies. The
        main
        points of contact stem from the facts that both the web
        infrastructure and the ontology needs to share the same criteria
        for
        identity, and that there are implications across the two tasks
        in the
        chosen language-expressivity and in consequences of updates.</p>
      <h2 class="western">Related projects and documents (draft)</h2>

      <h3 class="western">What codes identify: format and entities</h3>
      <p>BUFR/GRIB codes can be distinguished in two main groups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Codes that specify a message structure and decoding
            mechanisms (e.g.: Table C, Operators, or TableD, macros).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Codes that specify individuals, properties or classes used
            to denote (semantically) the content of the message (Table
            A,B and Common Tables). </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Codes in the first group have a semantics that is based on the
        assumption that a message is interpreted. A message is in fact
        read
        sequentially, and part of the BUFR/GRIB message structure
        provides an
        "header" that specifies a template to be used to interpret
        the message. When a code from Table D is encountered in the
        proper
        position, the corresponding "macro" is expanded, and when a
        code from Table C is found, the specified operation is carried.
        Details on the interpretation of GRIB/BUFR messages are out of
        the
        context of this document [REFER TO PROPER DOCS].</p>
      <p>It is important to note that a GRIB/BUFR message must be
        "executed" in order to explicit its meaning. Parts of the
        message are in fact a specification for "scanners<sup><a
            class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote1anc"
            href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a></sup>"
        whose application is contextual.</p>
      <p>Codes that specifies entities which denote (semantically) the
        content of a message are very varied in nature and usage. In
        particular:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Codes can refer to classes (e.g. data category),
            individuals (e.g.: center of origin) or properties<sup><a
                class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc"
                href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a></sup> (e.g.
            temperature).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Codes can be used in implicit or explicit statements. For
            instance Originating Center (Common Table 1) refers to an
            individual which is the object of a
            "subject-predicate-object" statement<sup><a
                class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc"
                href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a></sup> whose
            subject is the (implicit) message and whose (implicit)
            property is 'has originating center', where this property is
            identified by the byte-position in the message where the
            code appears. In other cases, a temperature code can be used
            to identify the meaning of a value it refers to, as it is
            the case for temperature (Table B, category 12).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>There is only an indirect and ambiguous distinction between
            codes that refer to object-properties (properties relating
            two entities) and data-type properties (properties relating
            an entity to its attributes). The former have as unit of
            measure "Code Table" which implies they refer to another
            entity, or a set of values!</p>

      <h3 class="western">Relations between codes and meaning</h3>
      <p>The relation between codes and meaning (intended as a

          <p>Complex codes. Some codes can point to different meanings
            depending on the use of other codes in other parts of the
            message. For instance the originating center of a message
            (implicit property) is defined via a code in Common Table
            11, while the sub-center is defined via a code from Common
            Table 12. However, these code work in combination. The code
            from Table 11 in fact is meant to refer to the center of
            origin when the code from Table 12 is zero, and is meant to

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Codes that don't refer to concepts. Some code (e.g. "3" in
            Common Code Table C1) are simply reserved for use from some
            institution (though it could be said that they refer to an
            unknown individual of a known class). Another example is
            code 255 in Table C1 (Missing value).</p>
        </li>

          <p>Codes that act as redirections. [MISSING EXAMPLE. DO THEY

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Partial codes. Some codes don't univocally denote an
            entity. For instance data-subcategories (Common Table 13)
            are only unique in combination with the code for the data
            category (Table A).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Codes that refer to more meanings, across versions or
            standards. For instance code 255 in Table A is "Indicator
            for local use" for CREX edition and "Other category" for
            CREX edition 2. Temperature in Table B have different unit
            of measures (K or C) for CREX or BUFR standards, thus
            denoting different concepts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Some code tables are redundant, probably because different
            tables are used in different parts of a message (E.g. Common

        </li>

          <p>Implicit hierarchies. In BUFR Codes and Flags Tables, codes
            corresponding to category 20003 (current weather) present an
            implicit hierarchy. In fact their description is asserted,
            for instance for code 00 (Cloud development not observed or
            not observable) and for the group 00-49 (No precipitation at
            the station at the time of observation). The latter is in
            practice a super-class fore the concepts denoted by codes
            00-49.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Flags. Some "codes" express combinations of different
            codes. In this case a code corresponds to different
            property-object assertions, or can denote an inconsistent
            condition.</p>

          <p>Combinatorics and Macros. In general, concepts can be
            represented in BUFR both via a specific code (e.g.: a code
            for "temperature in given scale with a given instrument") or
            via a Macro which compose the meaning out of "smaller" codes
            (e.g.: code for measure, code for scale, code for
            instrument). There seems to be no rule or convention on
            which approach to use. In general the same concepts can
            potentially be represented by different code combinations
            (or unique codes).</p>

      <h3 class="western">Distinction between codes and concepts</h3>
      <p>The first immediate conclusion of this analysis is that in
        representing BUFR terminologies, it is necessary to distinguish
        between between "codes" and "concepts".</p>
      <p><b>Codes</b></p>
      <p style="font-weight: normal">"Codes" are information
        artifacts used to represent concepts. They can have a
        code-specific
        definition (e.g.: reserved) and can have specific properties
        asserted
        (e.g.: encoding parameters). "Codes" are also annotated (or
        defined) via concepts, though this annotation can be complex. As
        definitions, properties, validation status or link to concept
        change,
        codes can be updates and hence they are versioned.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: normal">Codes can also represent
        non-concept
        BUFR elements as the macros or operators in, respectively, Table
        D
        and C.</p>
      <p><b>Concepts</b></p>
      <p>Concepts are identifier for an entity (class, individual or
        properties), which is encoded in BUFR/GRIB tables via one or
        more
        codes. Sometimes different concepts are encoded by the same code
        and
        disambiguated by other features, as for instance the standard.</p>
      <p>Concepts are related to each other via "semantic relations",
        for instance SKOS relations such as broader and narrower, and
        can be
        linked to other ontologies. Not all concepts are represented as
        codes. Some concepts are implicit in tables (e.g., the top level
        concept "temperature" for all "temperatures") or
        some concept can be added at later editing stage to structure
        the
        ontology.</p>
      <p><b>Relations among codes an concepts.</b></p>
      <p>Code and concepts can be related by high-level relations (e.g.:
        encodedBy or refersTo) or by more specific relations that
        explicit
        the way in which codes can be combined to refer univocally to a
        concept (in case, a "complex code" entity must be
        introduced.</p>
      <h3 class="western">The issue of maintenance and versioning</h3>
      <p>In the general case, a versioning system needs to be specified
        in
        the following aspects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Which are the allowed operations (e.g. update, delete,
            superseded, add,...) on codes and set of codes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Which are the states of codes and set of codes (e.g. valid,
            not-valid, testing)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Which are the effects of an operation on codes (e.g.:
            update of a label doesn't alter the validity status, but
            change in a definition may alter the status from valid to
            testing).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How change in a term transfer to the containing set: if a
            terms is altered and is invalid, is the Table containing it
            invalid ?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How changes are transferred across relations. If a concept
            is related to a code via an "encodedBy" relation. If the
            concept change status, is this new status "transferred"
            through the "encodedBy" relation to the code ? </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Versioning is related to the registry management standard
        specified in [REFER TO ISO DOC]. However this document is more
        concerned with the process of agreement and authority on
        (hierarchical) registries.</p>
      <h3 class="western">Formalization, merging, reasoning</h3>
      <p>The concept that can be generated through GRIB/BUFR tables can
        be
        structured in ontologies which can have a varied level of
        ontological
        commitment. Given the complexity of codes and their codes to
        concept
        relations, this can be done automatically only to a limited
        extent.</p>
      <p>For instance for measures in Table B (section 12), a SKOS
        formalization could be derived where all temperature types are
        considered as narrower concepts of a generic "temperature".
        However, there is no way to directly compute a hierarchy so that
        for
        instance a "Dew point temperature" could be considered a
        narrower concept than "temperature" and a broader concept
        of the three different dew points currently represented (they
        vary in
        the unit of measure or in the precision of the measure).</p>
      <p>Moving forward this structuring could be done in a
        semi-automatic
        way if the code description (which has a compositional nature)
        is
        broken down in its basic parts, then represented as properties
        of a
        concept. These could be used to formalize a simple OWL ontology
        out
        of which a SKOS ontology could be derived<sup><a
            class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote4anc"
            href="#sdfootnote4sym"><sup>4</sup></a></sup>.</p>
      <p>However this approach varies significantly between tables and
        sub
        tables. For instance the mentioned Codes and Flags table would
        require a different heuristics to extracts implicit hierarchies.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Scenario</b></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">For this
        reasons,
        the structuring of terminologies should be broken down in two
        steps:</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">- an automated
        step that extracts codes, concepts and their relations.
        Semantically,
        this step aims at disambiguating concepts in codes and can only
        provide some limited SKOS-like ontology structure.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">- a
        semi-automatic
        and interactive step where concepts are organized in ontologies,
        and
        matched to external ontologies.</p>
      <h3 class="western">Pilot proposal</h3>
      <p>A first pilot proposal aims at illustrating how a web-based
        representation can accommodate for concepts, codes and their
        relations, as well as versioning.</p>
