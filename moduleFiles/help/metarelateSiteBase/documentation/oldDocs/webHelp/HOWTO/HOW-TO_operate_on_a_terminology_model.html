    <h1>HOW-TO operate on a terminology model</h1>
    <p><font color="#000000">The Terminology Manager allows updates of a
        terminology model via a set of commands controlled by the metOp
        command line, whose functionalities are described here.<br>
        Mapping tables to a web representation, and publishing tables
        are operations performed via the metMap command. For an overview
        of the platforms and its component refer to the </font><a
href="file:///Users/andreasplendiani/code/eclipseWorkspace/MetOfficeTermRegistry/Documentation/web/Technical/Terminology_Manager_Platform_Design.html">Terminology

        Manager platform design</a> document.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Here are presented a few usage of the metOp utility.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Before operating metOp, it is necessary to configure the
      classpath properly. Example:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/test/MetOfficeTermRegistry/distrib/WMOTermReg.jar:/home/test/MetOfficeTermRegistry/libs/*</pre>
    <h2>Updating a term</h2>
    <p>A code (or register) can be updated when information is added (or
      modified) that does not affect its meaning or its commitments as a
      code. A simple example of update could be the addition of a label
      in a different language, or correction of a label mispelling.<br>
      A code (or register) can be updated via the following command:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>java uk.gov.metoffice.terminology.commandline.MetOp <br>-m&nbsp; tdb /home/test/DB/MetOffice <br>-o http://metoffice.gov.uk/wmo/ <br>-d "New label introduced" <br>-op addstats <br>-t http://reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo/tdcf/common/c-1/021 <br>-data file:///home/test/MetOfficeTermRegistry/examples/dumbUpdate.ttl<br><br></pre>
    Explanation:<br>
    -m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indicates the location of
    the triplestore<br>
    -o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the URI of the "agent"
    against whom the authorization to perform this operation on the
    specified code is checked<br>
    -d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a description for this
    action<br>
    -op&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the operation to be performed
    (internally represented as a URL). addstat issues a monotonous
    update of the information relative to a code (versioned, if
    versioning is active for the code).<br>
    -t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the target of the operation<br>
    -data&nbsp;&nbsp; a file containing the new statements to be added
    to the code (turtle syntax)<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#ff0000">Note: the specific syntax of the above command
      is currently changing. Explanations will be provided via --help.</font><br>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Obsoleting a term</h2>
    <p>A code can be removed from a register from its next version via a
      delete command. In the current configuration, the code changes
      status in a newer version and becomes obsolete. The register, in a
      newer version, does not include the code anymore (its still
      include it in versions prior to this operation). The command to
      obsolete a term in a register is the following:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>java uk.gov.metoffice.terminology.commandline.MetOp <br>-m&nbsp; tdb /Users/andreasplendiani/DB/MetOfficeLocal <br>-o http://metoffice.gov.uk/wmo/ <br>-d "Code deleted" <br>-op del <br>-t http://reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo/tdcf/common/c-1/022 <br>-r http://reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo/tdcf/common/c-1<br><br></pre>
    The parameters have the same meaning of those presented for the
    update command. With the addition of:<br>
    -r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The register from which the term should be
    obsoleted.<br>
    <p>Note that the specification of -r is redundant if a code can
      reside only in one register, which is the current implementation.<br>
      <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      <font color="#ff0000">Note: the specific syntax of the above
        command is currently changing. Explanations will be provided via
        --help.</font><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Adding a new term</h2>
    <p>A new code can be added to a register as follow:</p>
    <pre>java uk.gov.metoffice.terminology.commandline.MetOp <br>-m&nbsp; 	tdb /home/test/DB/MetOffice <br>-o 	http://metoffice.gov.uk/wmo/ <br>-d 	"New code added" <br>-op 	add <br>-t 	http://reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo/tdcf/common/c-1/300 <br>-r 	http://reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo/tdcf/common/c-1 <br>-data 	file:///home/test/MetOfficeTermRegistry/examples/demoEntity.ttl<br><br></pre>
    <p>we focus on the options that have some variations from the above
      commands:</p>
    <p>-t The URI of the new code introduced<br>
      -r The register where to add the code<br>
      -data A file containing statements proper of the code (inc. its
      type!)</p>
    <pre></pre>
    <p><font color="#ff0000">Note: the specific syntax of the above
        command is currently changing. Explanations will be provided via
        --help.</font><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Superseding a term</h2>
    <p>A new code can be introduced that replaces an existing term,
      basically combining the introduction of a new term and the
      obsoletion of a term already present.<br>
    </p>
    <pre>java uk.gov.metoffice.terminology.commandline.MetOp <br>-m&nbsp; 	tdb /home/test/DB/MetOffice <br>-o 	http://metoffice.gov.uk/wmo/ <br>-d 	"Term superseding" <br>-op 	superseed <br>-t 	http://reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo/tdcf/common/c-1/080 <br>-sup 	http://reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo/tdcf/common/c-1/300 <br>-r 	http://reference.metoffice.gov.uk/data/wmo/tdcf/common/c-1<br></pre>
    <p>Here:<br>
    </p>
    <p>-t&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the term to be obsoleted
      <br>
      -sup&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the superseding term<br>
      -r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the register where the new
      term is introduced, an the old term was contained.<br>
    </p>
    <p> <font color="#ff0000">Note: the specific syntax of the above
        command is currently changing. Explanations will be provided via
        --help.</font></p>
