<body>Exception used in the system. Some exception e.g.: {@link uk.gov.metoffice.terminology.exceptions.AuthException} and
{@link uk.gov.metoffice.terminology.exceptions.RegistryManagerException} can be seen in part as control elements.
However, their use as such should be restricted in the command line (e.g.: command fails if authorization exception is risen) and not systematically within the system.
