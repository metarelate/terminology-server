Template elements used by the template manager.
Template elements implement a few interfaces that are meant to represent templates that never change, that change for each code, 
or that present parameters depending on the terminology as a whole.
However, this interface approach is badly designed, as effectively only a few methods are called, with null values are not relevant for the specific case.
